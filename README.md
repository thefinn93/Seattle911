This plugin checks a list of subreddits for new posts and announces them in IRC as they come in.

Install the plugin, then configure supybot.plugins.SubredditAnnouncer.subreddits in this format:
```
#channel:subreddit+subreddit+subreddit+subreddit #channel:subreddit+subreddit
```

Pull requests, bugreports, etc are always welcome.
